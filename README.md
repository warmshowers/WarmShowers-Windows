WarmShowers-Windows
===================

This is the home for Warm Showers for WP7, WP8, and Windows projects.
* <a href="https://github.com/warmshowers/WarmShowers-Windows/blob/master/WarmShowers/WSWP7/Release%20History.md">Release history</a>
* Apps communicate with WarmShowers.org through <a href="https://github.com/warmshowers/Warmshowers.org/wiki/Warmshowers-RESTful-Services-for-Mobile-Apps">Warmshowers RESTful Services for Mobile Apps</a>.
* Currently only the WP7 app is published to the Marketplace/Store, and is the only source included here.  The native WP7 app also works on WP8, WP8.1, and WP10 (probably).
* To build, load the WarmShowers solution (WarmShowers.sln) into Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Phone.  Newer Visual Studio versions may or may not be able to target WP7.  And that may or may not matter.
* The WP7 app is currently in maintenance mode, no major features are planned.  A WP8.1 app and (maybe) a Universal App are planned.
* Visit www.warmshowers.org for more information about the entire Warm Showers ecosystem.
* For bugs and feature requests, please submit a new github issue or comment on an existing one.  Or post on the WS forum for mobile apps: www.warmshowers.org/mobile
